**Have you make all of this app**

NO...
I only make the GUI for this Miner.
["Coopers"](https://t.me/astarzo) have made the ["Multitread Miner"](https://github.com/kerastinell/HTMLCOIN/releases/tag/v2.0.1.0-mt).

**Why are make the App?**

I see in the Telegram Channel that many Windows Users are not bring Coopers Miner to work. And i have the error that after one Day the Miners get out of work and i didnt noticed that. With the Gui its easyer to work with the Miner and you can see if something gets wrong.

**Can we Donaite to Cooper?**

YES PLEASE MAKE IT !!!
My Gui works only with Coopers Miner. So everybody of us must have Donations for Beer.....

**Where are the HTML Adress to Donaite?**
