# About the App

**Who are you?**

I am Marcus Berger, a 42 year old IT-Administrator from Germany.
You can contact me over [E-Mail](bmp [at] gmx [dot] de) or [Telegram](https://t.me/marcusberger)

**Did you make all of this app?**

NO... I only make the GUI for this Miner.
["Cooper"](https://t.me/astarzo) made the ["Multithread Miner"](https://github.com/kerastinell/HTMLCOIN/releases/tag/v2.0.1.0-mt).

**Why did you make the app?**

I see in the Telegram Channel that many Windows Users are unable to make Cooper's Miner work. After one day, I did not notice miners did not work. With GUI, it is easier to work with the miner and see if something goes wrong.

**Can we donate to Cooper?**

YES PLEASE MAKE DO !!!
My GUI works only with Cooper's Miner. So, everyone of us must donate Beer..... üç∫üç∫üç∫
