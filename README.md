# Why use this App ?

The program makes it easier to use the miner.
In this way, the matching threads are preselected based on the available cores.
The blocks found are displayed at any time. Just like the existing connections. 
The CPU load is also displayed and is an important parameter to see if the miners are working.

# How match Cost the App

The app is free.
But at the start of the app I have a 30 seconds break to think about my work.

# How can i break the break

Its easy just contact me(bmp@gmx.de) and after a Donation i give you a Regestration Code for the App.
*But i have allready Donaite in the past for the old App*
Then just contact me and i send you the Code.

# Why you now make a new App ?

The old App is make for the original Miner.
But Cooper's miner is much better and find more Blocks.
