# Why use this App?

The program makes it easier to use the miner.
You can match threads based on the available cores.
After an error, the mining process restarts itself.

These stats are displayed at all times:
* CPU load,
* blocks found,
* peer connections,
* HTMLCoin Balance, 
* Block# and,
* CPU load. 

CPU load is an important parameter to see if the miners is working.

# How much does the app cost?

The app is free. At the start of the app, I have a 30 second break to think about my work.

# How can I break the break?

It is easy just [contact me](mailto:bmp@gmx.de) and after a donation I give you a Registration Code for the App.

*But I have already Donated in the past for the old App*
Then just contact me and I send you the Code.

**What is the HTML Address to Donate?**
